<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><em>Application: IPA English</em></p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the <strong>IPA English</strong> application (“We” or “Application”). We respect users’ privacy and are committed to protecting personal information. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect data in the course of providing our services, including displaying ads from Google AdMob.</p>
<p>If you are under 13 years old, please read this policy with a parent or guardian.</p>

<h2>2. Scope of Application</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This policy applies to all users, including children under 13, when using IPA English.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Device information (operating system, app version, language, etc.).</li>
  <li>Anonymized usage data (frequency of app usage, features used, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Personally identifiable information</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>We <strong>do not</strong> require you to provide name, email address, phone number, or any other personal identifying information, unless it is necessary for a specific feature (if any).</li>
  <li>If any feature requires personal information, we will notify you and request explicit consent from a parent/guardian (for users under 13).</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. How We Use the Information</h2>
<p><strong>1. Analysis and Service Improvement</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Anonymized data helps us understand how users interact with the Application, so we can improve features and user experience.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Advertising (AdMob)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The Application uses Google AdMob to display ads.</li>
  <li>AdMob may collect anonymous device information (such as an advertising ID) to personalize or serve relevant ads.</li>
  <li>For more details, please refer to the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a> and the <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdMob Policy</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Compliance with Child Protection Laws (COPPA)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>For users under 13, we configure AdMob to limit the collection of personal data and to show non-personalized ads (if applicable).</li>
  <li>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without parental/guardian consent. If we discover any personal information of a child under 13 has been collected without consent, we will delete that information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Information Sharing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We <strong>do not sell, trade, or share</strong> personally identifiable information with third parties.</li>
  <li>Anonymized information (e.g., device ID) may be shared with advertising service providers (Google AdMob) to display ads.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Security</h2>
